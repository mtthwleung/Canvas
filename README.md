# CanvasProject

Welcome to our Canvas!

To use the canvas, simply select the tool of your choice and the colour with which you wish to draw.
By default, the selected tool is a freeform brush, and the selected colour is black.

To draw a shape, select one of our tools and click & drag on the canvas to create the shape. The selected shape will have a black border surrounding the icon.
There are 7 tools available (brush, eraser, circle, rectangle, triangle, line, and curved line).

The brush width is controlled by a slider on the bottom of the panel - dragging it to the left will set a narrow border for your shapes, and to the right will set a thick border.

On the left side of the bottom panel are 4 pre-set colors (black, blue, red, yellow), and a colour picker which allows you to customize whatever colour you want to use. Use the slider on the colour picker to adjust the RGB (red, blue, green).
The circular colour to the left displays the colour that is currently selected.

When drawing circles, rectangles, and triangles, you are also given the additional option to fill the entire area of the shape with your selected colour.
To do this, check the "fill color" checkbox directly underneath the colour options and begin drawing.

The 'fill background' icon directly to the right of the colors changes the entire background of the canvas to your selected colour when you click it.
Be careful - this will erase any drawings currently on the canvas. A warning will appear the first time you click, but will no longer subsequently appear unless you refresh the page.

The undo and redo arrows allow you to revert any changes you have made to the canvas. They revert the last change you have made (from clicking to releasing the mouse).

The 'clear canvas' button erases everything you have drawn on the canvas and resets the background to white.
The undo button still works after you have cleared your canvas.

Once you have completed your work, you can save the final product to your local computer by clicking 'Save As Image'.
